3-4 People. If we're able to have 4 People, that would be great to be able to assign 2 people to each side (Frontend / Backend). I'm calling it Frontend / Backend (despite it not actually being frontend/backend of an application) to represent how one
side will be very technical in terms of machine learning engineering coding (backend), whereas the other side will be much more focused on formalizing work into a presentation and abstract (frontend).



By 2/6: Setup

Machine Learning and Data (Backend of Project)
	
All data found and converted into interactive format. Put links to download data in a collective document so that everyone is using the same data in the model. Have this part done by 2/4 so that everyone can experiment with the data. (If there is any non open data we have to get, that’s fine if it takes longer to get access to it; just put in a request to get it by 2/4). Ideally, we will have one cohesive csv or xlsx file for us all to use.

Get the following python libraries setup on your computer:
	Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn (for data manipulation)
TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch (for machine learning, note that not having all three of these is okay). If you want to use another library, that’s all good, just let the other group members know.

Once those libraries are set up, try playing around with the data. See if you can get it into a machine learning model in Python, and if you struggle at all, just ask your groupmates.

Presentation (Front End of Project)

If desired, we can create a website to present our findings. Josh is semi-comfortable with creating an app using React and PNPM (tools from Full-Stack Javascript).

What would be simpler would be to create a Tableau application. I (Josh) have never used Tableau, so I do not know what it is capable of, but I understand that it is a good tool for sharing data and graphs.

Additionally, if group members desire to do so, we could write an academic paper.

We will discuss as a group what route we want to go. By 2/6, we will know what presentation means we want to do.

Expected Time: 1-3 Hours Per Person

By 2/13: Starting to Get Valuable Insights

Machine Learning and Data

Examine possible applications of time series analysis in the context of soccer seasons. Ideally, one person would do this. Import some time series analysis libraries (one I know of is Sktime) in Python, and see if any ideas like seasonality, autocorrelation, etc. (you can google these to learn more about them) are applicable to the project. Test out in code 

Presentation

If we are writing a paper, have the abstract drafted.
